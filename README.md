## Completed Features
1. Two-view navigation
2. Input fields and drop-down menus to collect instrument and owner information
3. Cards to capture owner first name and instrument details
4. Instrument data can be deleted without deleting an owners' ID card
  4a. When another instrument is added to that owners' name, the empty card is updated instead of populating an unnecessary additional card
5. Multiple cards available per owner, per instrument
6. Check in / Check out toggle feature that changes the card's appearance if checked in or checked out and logs the status back to the database. 
7. On the Musicians/Owners view, a table populates with musicians' first names and the number of instruments on file per name. 

## Next Steps
1. An 'edit' feature will populate on each card and that cards inputs can be updated.
2. Build a public view that allows clients to check their own instruments in to the database.
3. Consider a 'deleteOwner' function.
4. Design 404.html
